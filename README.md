I have been trying different linux distros in the past years and found myself coming back to Fedora a few times until I finally settled with it for my daily driver. I wanted to automate things I did after the initial installation, so here it is:

A comprehensive post-installation setup script collection for Fedora Linux, focusing on gaming, development, and multimedia support. Features automated setup of drivers, codecs, gaming tools, development environments, and quality-of-life improvements.

- Custom `.bashrc` configuration with useful aliases and functions
- Custom executable scripts in `usr/bin/`
- Preconfigured dotfiles in `.config/` for various applications
- A post-installation script (`post_install.sh`) that sets up various system configurations

## Features

### Packages To Install

The dnf and flatpak packages to be installed to the system can be found and modified in `post_install.sh` under `Software Installation` section.

### Custom Tools

#### grun (NVIDIA Prime + Gamescope + Gamemoderun + Proton Env Vars)
`grun` is placed in `/usr/bin` since Steam launch options could only see it when it is placed there.

A flexible gaming launcher, or just a convenience script, that combines NVIDIA Prime switching, Gamescope, GameMode and some Proton env vars:
- Automatically sets env vars to switch to DGPU with Prime
- Pre-configured display presets:
  - Monitor mode (4K @ 60Hz)
  - Laptop mode (2560x1600 @ 165Hz)
  - Projector mode (1080p @ 60Hz)
- Special RPG Maker mode with pixel-perfect scaling
- Vulkan/Proton optimizations (DXVK async + Wined3D)
- NVIDIA Optimus support
- HDR and adaptive sync support

Usage examples:
```bash
# Run with monitor preset and GameMode
grun -mg steam://rungameid/123456

# Run with laptop preset and Vulkan optimizations
grun -lv %command%

# Custom resolution with FSR upscaling
grun --gamescope-args="-W 1280 -H 720 -F fsr" %command%
```

For full options and shortcuts, run: `grun --help`
